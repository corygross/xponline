By clicking on the arrows on the top of the messenger section, the messenger can be collapsed to the side.

Clicking on a user's name opens a chat window with them.

User's with a blue box around their name have chatted with me, but have not sent anything I haven't read.

User's with an orange box have sent new messages that I have not yet read.

When the message panel is collapsed, there is an orange indicator if someone has sent me a message I haven't read.

The red highlighted line is the one that the other user is typing on.  I am locked out.  Maybe add a little picture of the person editing next to that line?
